            1. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and
            ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.
            <br />
            2. Anything that's invented between when you’re 15 and 35 is new and
            exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.
            <br />
            3. Anything invented after you're 35 is against the natural order of
            things.”

            In 2003 I was 15, just getting started programming, I was mostly
            writing scripts and editing config files on my Linux PCs. By 2005 I
            was working as a programmer, writing SQL, VB and C# for insurance
            salesmen to help them increase the output of their leads business.
            This is how I got started as a software engineer. It was awesome. In
            this way I identify with the boomers.
        </p>

        <p>
            I graduated college in 2012, started working as a software engineer,
            right when
            <a href="https://a16z.com/why-software-is-eating-the-world/"
                >@pmarca declared Software was eating the world</a
            >. Became a dad in 2014, bought our first house in 2016. By 2022 I
            had tripled my income, but that kind of decade is rare and precious,
            and reality set in. ChatGPT was launched that year. Russia invaded
            Ukraine, interest rates went back up from 0 to something reasonable,
            like 7%. History was <i>back</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
            By 2023 I had gone through my first layoff and come to terms with
            the sinking reality that AI will eat your software job sooner or
            later. Oh what a coincidence, that's the year I was 35. wtf I'm a
            Luddite now.

        <p>
            Douglas Adams was right. Being post-35 I now see all the new
            technological developments as against the natural order of things.
