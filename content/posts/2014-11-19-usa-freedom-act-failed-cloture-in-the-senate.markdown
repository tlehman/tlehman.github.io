title: USA FREEDOM Act Failed Cloture in the Senate

The Senate version of the [USA FREEDOM Act failed cloture*](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/s2685) yesterday. Senator Patrick Leahy made changes to the [house version of the bill](/blog/2014/05/23/usa-freedom-act-passes-house). This bill would have been a necessary, albeit incremental check on the NSA's wide-reaching surveillance programs.

* cloture is a procedure to end debate and move forward on a vote.
