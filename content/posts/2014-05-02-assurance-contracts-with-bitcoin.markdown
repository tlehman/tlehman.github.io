This is a great [article by Arianna Simpson](http://www.ariannasimpson.com/game-theory-assurance-contracts) about using bitcoin to implement assurance contracts. The example she uses is crowdfunding. 

This is an example of using [cryptocurrencies to implement contract law](/blog/2014/02/23/how-contract-law-could-become-a-form-of-computing/). It completely removes the need for a third party enforcer, and it shows how security systems can not only augment, but actually replace institutions that use legal pressure to make people cooperate.

In [Bruce Schneier's Liars and Outliers](http://amzn.com/1118143302), he identitied three societal trust mechanisms:

 - Moral Pressure
 - Reputational Pressure
 - Institutional Pressure

And then showed that security systems can augment and even replace certain forms of societal pressure to reduce the need for trust in individuals. Bitcoin and other blockchain-backed technologies can do this for many types of contract law. I am excited to see how well this works in practice.
