title: Open Primaries in Oregon could render political parties irrelevant

There is a promising measure on the Oregon ballot this year, [Measure 90](http://www.90fororegon.org/).

If Measure 90 passes, it would replace the primary election system that is currently in place. Right now, voters must register with a political party first, and then vote for candidates in that party in the primary elections. The winners for the primary for each party then go on to the general election.

One huge problem with this approach is that voters must commit to a single party for the primary election. This means that it is not possible to vote for a senator in one party and a governor in a different party. I've written before that I don't think [political parties are anything more than loosely organized tribal groups](/blog/2014/01/10/political-parties-are-more-like-tribes-than-consistent-philosophies).

This also limits the ability for smaller parties (Independent, Green Party, Libertarian, etc.) to elect candidates, because in the primaries, voters must register with a party first. So if that person wants to vote for a few Democrats and a Green, or a few Republicans and a Libertarian, they would have to choose only one party and neglect the others. This tends to support the dominant parties, Republicans and Democrats, since they are the most numerous. There is a [rational way to calculate the most effective tradeoff](/blog/2012/09/04/optimize-your-vote-using-statistics), but there is a better way.

Having to choose a party, and then choose a representative adds more layers between the citizen and the laws that ultimately passed. Right now, us citizens don't vote directly on most laws, we elect representatives to do that for us. And without open primaries, we also cede even more power to the existing parties, instead, we should ignore parties and just vote for the representatives directly.

This is a great opportunity for Oregon residents to strip out an unnecessary layer of indirection from the election process, if you care about ending the Democratic/Republican-dominated primary elections, vote yes on Measure 90.
