A while back I wrote about a program to [record changing the state of an adjustible height standing desk](/blog/2014/08/18/script-for-logging-standing-desk-state-transitions/)
after about 3 months of gathering data on how long my desk is in the `up` state, I found this:

With a mean of 54 minutes, 6 seconds, I usually stand for under an hour at a time.

I'm not sure if this is too much or too little. More research needed.
