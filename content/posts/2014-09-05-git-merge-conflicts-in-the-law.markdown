title: Git merge conflicts in the Law

Short post, just wanted to share this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I am resolving git merge conflicts in the law. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/lovemyjob?src=hash">#lovemyjob</a></p>&mdash; Joshua Tauberer (@JoshData) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshData/status/508001292078559232">September 5, 2014</a></blockquote>

It reminded me of an earlier post I had on [viewing changes to law as a diff](/blog/2013/09/14/viewing-nsa-accountability-act-amendments-as-a-diff/)

I am a big fan of [Joshua Tauberer](http://razor.occams.info/)'s work, his site [GovTrack.us](http://govtrack.us) has been a great resource for following what Congress is doing, (and what it's [not doing](https://www.govtrack.us/blog/2013/12/18/closing-out-2013-with-policy-unfinished/)). If you haven't seen it, I recommend you check it out.
