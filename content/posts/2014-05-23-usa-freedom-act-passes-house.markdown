title: USA FREEDOM Act passes house

About 9 months ago I wrote about [NSA bulk spying and how the way the FISA court is being used upsets the balance of powers in the government](/blog/2013/08/13/an-unbalance-of-powers/), the [two](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr2586) [bills](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr2761) I referenced have a 4% and 2% chance of being enacted, according to GovTrack. Both of those bills still haven't left the House, and chances are they won't.

A more promising bill is the USA FREEDOM Act, which just passed the House:

Unforunately, Rep. Justin Amash noted that the changes to it are so bad, that most of the original co-sponsors are out:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Just how bad were changes to <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23USAFREEDOMAct&amp;src=hash">#USAFREEDOMAct</a>? MAJORITY of 152 cosponsors voted NO. Roll call: <a href="http://t.co/2kaG5hrmw1">http://t.co/2kaG5hrmw1</a> <a href="http://t.co/13gUpANOEN">http://t.co/13gUpANOEN</a></p>&mdash; Justin Amash (@repjustinamash) <a href="https://twitter.com/repjustinamash/statuses/469883039125106689">May 23, 2014</a></blockquote>

Also, the [EFF doesn't approve](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/05/eff-dismayed-houses-gutted-usa-freedom-act). Fortunately, Sen. Patrick Leahy said he intends on [fixing a lot of those problems in the Senate version of the bill](https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/comment-of-senator-patrick-leahy-d-vt_chairman-senate-judiciary-committee-on-house-passage-of-the-usa-freedom-act-).

It's easy to get cynical and fatalistic about the erosion of civil liberties and the problems in government, but recognizing the problems and paying attention, putting pressure on congress can make a difference. Stay rational and contact your [representative](http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/) and [senators](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm).

Remember that the Congress is the most powerful branch of government, it makes and destroys laws, with or without the President's consent (1). Each and every member of congress cares about what we citizens think, because they wish to be re-elected, and we elect them. They are more accesible than you might think.


(1) Even if the President vetos a bill, Congress can still override with a [2/3 supermajority in both houses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#United_States)
