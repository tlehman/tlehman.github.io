If you have one of Google's awesome [Nexus 7 tablets](http://www.google.com/nexus/#/), but don't have a
stand, here is a great way to make your own, all you need is the
original box.

## Step 1

Start with the part of the box that held the tablet, shown below.

Punch a hole in the middle of the bottom part, that will be where the
USB cable goes.

## Step 2

Orient the box that held the charger at such an angle that the tablet
rests and holds the box in place (shown below).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>{% img /images/blogimg/nexus7stand/step2.JPG %}</td>
    <td>{% img /images/blogimg/nexus7stand/step3.JPG %}</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Step 3

Use some duct tape to hold the box in place (shown below).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>{% img /images/blogimg/nexus7stand/step4.JPG %}</td>
    <td>{% img /images/blogimg/nexus7stand/step5.JPG %}</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Now the box stays put when you remove the tablet, this provides a firm
foundation for the tablet in the future.

## Step 4

Punch a hole in the side of the box, and run the USB cable used for
charging through the hole (shown below).
