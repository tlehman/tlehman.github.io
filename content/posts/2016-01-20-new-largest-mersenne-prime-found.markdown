title: New largest Mersenne prime found

The largest prime number was just found, and it is a [Mersenne prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_prime), or a prime number of the form 2<sup>n</sup> - 1. As of January 2016, 2<sup>74,207,281</sup> - 1 is the largest known prime. Primes are interesting in their own right, but they also are indispensible in cryptography.

We've known since Euclid that the number of primes is infinite, but it is still an open problem whether the number of Mersenne primes is infinite:


> Conjecture   A Mersenne prime is a Mersenne number M<sub>n</sub>  = 2<sup>p</sup>  - 1  that is prime.
> Are there infinite number of Mersenne Primes?
