Washington state has two contradictory initiatives on the ballot this year.

> Initiative 591 (I-591) would prevent background checks for gun purchases except when required by the federal government. 

> Initiative 594 (I-594) would ensure background checks for all gun purchases, including those conducted online and at gun shows.

This kind of thing shouldn't even be let onto the ballot. There should be something akin to a compiler that can weed out laws that are 

 1. Contradictory to one another
 2. Contradictory to existing law

The first requirement is easy, the second requirement is harder, I mentioned it [here](/blog/2013/09/14/viewing-nsa-accountability-act-amendments-as-a-diff/).

Of course, Courts do serve this role, but only after laws are passed and people contest it. I think there is still room for cleaning the process up a bit and weeding out mutually contradictory laws that show up on the same ballot!
