title: Switching to a static blog platform

I have been looking for an alternative to WordPress for a while, one that I can understand at the code level. I found XavierShay's [enki blog](http://enkiblog.com/) platform and I like it a lot, it is made in rails and uses OpenID for authentication. However, I found myself using a text editor to first write my posts and then pasting them into the web editor.

Most in-browser editors right now are not as nice as native ones. Also, blog content doesn't need the full power of a relational database, so I looked around for a static blog generator, and found [Octopress](http://octopress.org). It is self-described as "a blogging framework for hackers". It is written in ruby and doesn't require a database or authentication. I do prefer this approach, so I switched over.
