title: Lies Damned Lies and Statistics

There is a quote, usually attributed to Mark Twain that goes something 
like: 

> "There are three kinds lies. 
> Lies, Damned Lies, and Statistics."

My interpretation of this is that statistics are supposed to be the
worst kind of lie, or that the worst kinds of lies use
statistics.

The thing that bothers me most about this quote (and the innumerable
minor variations of it that get repeated) is that the word
'statistics' comes at the end.

Why does that matter? Notice that the list is presented as a sequence,
an increasing sequence of damned-ness, and the presence of the word 
'statistics' at the end is supposed to imply that it is 'more damned'
than damned lies.

This interpretation bothers me because the implied damned-ness is
based on the initial correlation, and that correlation is only based
on two data points. The quote depends on a misunderstanding of
statistics. Anyone who has studied a little bit of statistics will
know not to trust an inference based on a correlation in a data set
of only two points!
