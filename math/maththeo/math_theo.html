<h1 id="sec:introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This is my attempt to formulate the Catholic theology of the Trinity
in mathematical language. If you find any errors in the math or the
theology, please email me at <a
href="mailto:mail@tobilehman.com">mail@tobilehman.com</a>, I care deeply
about getting this right. To my mathematician’s eyes, the Catechism of
the Catholic Church (<a
href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_INDEX.HTM">CCC</a>) has
parts that remind me of a mathematical text. The axiomatic truths
asserted early on, the precise and consistent use of language, the
fidelity to reason. I don’t know if the entire Catechism could be
written to look like a math text, or if it even should, but I think the
doctrine of trinity can. This is my best attempt to do so. God
bless.</p>

<h2 id="sec:god-is-father">Interpreting "God is the Father"</h2>
<p>Bill Clinton once reminded us that it depends on what your definition
of "is" is. We have formalized the sentences like "The Father is
consubstantial with the Son", but then defined God as the category that
contains the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. What does it mean to say that
"God is the Father" (In our notation: <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> "is" <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span>)?</p>
<h3 id="sec:is-functors">The <span
class="math inline">\(\text{Is}\)</span> Functors</h3>
<p>We interpret the sentence "God is the Father" using the <span
class="math inline">\(\text{Is}_F : \mathcal{G} \to
\mathcal{G}\downarrow F\)</span> <a
href="#sec:functors">Functor</a>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\downarrow F\)</span> is the
<a href="#sec:slice-category">slice category</a> construction, which
makes a category out of an object that isomorphic to <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{1}\)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="sec:functors">Functors</h4>
<p>Given a category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> and
a category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span>, a
<strong>functor</strong> is a mapping from the objects of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> to the objects of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span>, such that morphism
composition is preserved. So if <span class="math inline">\(f : A \to
B\)</span> is a morphism in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(F(f) : F(A) \to F(B)\)</span> is a morphism in
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="sec:slice-category">Slice Category</h4>
<p>Given a category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> and
an object <span class="math inline">\(c \in
\text{ob}(\mathcal{C})\)</span>, the <strong>slice category</strong>
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\downarrow c\)</span> is a
category where:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Objects are morphisms <span class="math inline">\(f : x \to
c\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Morphisms from <span class="math inline">\(f : x \to c\)</span>
to <span class="math inline">\(g : y \to c\)</span> are morphisms <span
class="math inline">\(h : x \to y\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(g \circ h = f\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sec:lemma-groupoid">Lemma 1.1: <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> is a groupoid</h2>
<p>A <a
href="https://math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/context.pdf#page=25">groupoid</a> is
a category in which every morphism is an isomorphism. That’s another way
of saying every morphism has an inverse.</p>
<h3 id="sec:proof-groupoid">Proof:</h3>
<p>If you look at the hom-sets above, you will see that for every <span
class="math inline">\(\text{Hom}(X,Y)\)</span> there’s a <span
class="math inline">\(\text{Hom}(Y,X)\)</span>. Without loss of
generality, consider <span
class="math inline">\(\text{Hom}(F,S)\)</span>, which asserts that "The
Father is consubstantial with The Son".</p>
<h1 id="sec:axioms">Axioms</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>There is one God (<a
href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P16.HTM">CCC:200</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>There are three Divine Persons, The Father, The Son and The Holy
Spirit. All are fully God. (<a

<li><p>The Father is consubstantial with The Son, who is consubstantial
with the Holy Spirit. (<a

<span class="math display">\[\forall x :

</ol>
<h1 id="sec:trinity">The Most Holy Trinity</h1>
<p>God is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The use of the word
"is" doesn’t follow the same transitive rules as <span
class="math inline">\(=\)</span> in mathematics. There’s another branch
of math that deals with this, category theory. Category theory goes
beyond the idea of "strict equality" and focuses on relationships and
mappings between objects. This distinction will be useful in trying to
understand the Trinity.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(G = \text{God}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(F = \text{The Father}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(S = \text{The Son}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(H = \text{The Holy Spirit}\)</span>.</p>
<p>If "is" was the normal <span class="math inline">\(=\)</span> sign,
then we could prove something false.</p>
<div class="tcolorbox">
<p>If Father = God and Son = God, then Father = Son.</p>
<p>(We will call this the transitivity error).</p>
</div>
<p>To avoid false arguments like the above, we have to define "Is" in a
precise way.</p>
<h2 id="sec:def-is">Definitions of "Is":</h2>
<h3 id="sec:def-divine-person">Definition of "<span
class="math inline">\(\text{Divine Person}\)</span> is God"</h3>
<p>We define the following functors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\text{Is}_F : \mathcal{G}\downarrow F
\to \mathcal{G}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\text{Is}_S : \mathcal{G}\downarrow S
\to \mathcal{G}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\text{Is}_H : \mathcal{G}\downarrow H
\to \mathcal{G}\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The way we defined <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span>
means that <strong>the whole category</strong> is God. The objects, like
<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> are not equal to the whole, but
they are equivalent in the above precise sense.</p>
<h3 id="sec:proof-no-transitivity">Proof that <span
class="math inline">\(\text{Is}_x\)</span> avoids the transitivity
error</h3>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(\text{Is}_F\)</span> functor asserts
that the Father is equivalent to God.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(\text{Is}_S\)</span> functor asserts
that the Son is equivalent to God.</p>
<div class="center">

</div>
<p>The diagram above says that "The Father is God" and that "The Son is
God", but it does not say that "The Father is the Son".</p>
<p>The Father <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is
<em>consubstantial with</em> (<span
class="math inline">\(\stackrel{\dagger}{=}\)</span>) The Son <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\stackrel{\dagger}{=}_{FS} : F \to
S\]</span></p>
<p>But the <span class="math inline">\(\stackrel{\dagger}{=}_{FS} : F
\to S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{Is}_S :
\mathcal{G}\downarrow S \to \mathcal{G}\)</span> arrows don’t compose.
Graphically, you cannot find a path from <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> that goes through <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span>, this is how the above
definition avoids the transitivity error.</p>
<h1 id="sec:filioque">The Filioque and the Great Schism of 1054</h1>
<p>The <strong>Filioque</strong> (Latin for "and the Son") is a
theological doctrine concerning the procession of the Holy Spirit. This
doctrine became a major point of contention between the Eastern and
Western churches, ultimately contributing to the Great Schism of 1054
that divided Christianity into Roman Catholicism and Eastern
Orthodoxy.</p>
<h2 id="sec:western-filioque">The Western Position: Filioque</h2>
<p>The Western Church (Roman Catholic) teaches that the Holy Spirit
proceeds from both the Father and the Son. In our categorical framework,
this can be represented as:</p>
<div class="center">

</div>
<p>To emphasize the Filioque doctrine, we highlight the joint source of
the Holy Spirit’s procession:</p>
<div class="center">

</div>
<p>Both the Father (<span
class="math inline">\(\textcolor{red}{F}\)</span>) and the Son (<span
class="math inline">\(\textcolor{red}{S}\)</span>) are highlighted in
red, indicating that according to Western theology, the Holy Spirit
proceeds from both persons of the Trinity.</p>
<h2 id="sec:eastern-no-filioque">The Eastern Position: No Filioque</h2>
<p>The Eastern Orthodox Church maintains that the Holy Spirit proceeds
from the Father alone, though <em>through</em> the Son. This distinction
preserves what they see as the Father’s role as the sole source (Greek:
<em>monarchia</em>) within the Trinity.</p>
<p>In categorical terms, the Eastern position would emphasize only the
morphism from <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span>:</p>
<div class="center">

</div>
<p>Only the Father (<span
class="math inline">\(\textcolor{blue}{F}\)</span>) is highlighted in
blue, emphasizing the Eastern teaching that procession originates solely
from the Father.</p>
<h2 id="sec:great-schism">The Great Schism of 1054</h2>
<p>The theological disagreement over the Filioque was one of several
factors that led to the mutual excommunications between Pope Leo IX and
Patriarch Michael I Cerularius in 1054. This event formally split the
Christian Church into:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>Roman Catholic Church</strong> (West): Affirming the
Filioque</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Eastern Orthodox Church</strong> (East): Rejecting
the Filioque</p></li>
</ul>
<p>From a categorical perspective, both churches agree on the
fundamental structure of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> as a groupoid with objects
<span class="math inline">\(\{F, S, H\}\)</span> and consubstantial
relations. The disagreement lies in the <em>interpretation</em> of the
arrows and their directional significance regarding procession.</p>
<p>The Western emphasis on the joint procession from Father and Son can
be seen as highlighting the symmetric nature of the groupoid structure,
while the Eastern emphasis on procession from the Father alone maintains
a hierarchical reading of the morphisms that preserves the Father’s
unique role as <em>principium sine principio</em> (principle without
principle).</p>
