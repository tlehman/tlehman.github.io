      <description>I remember reading this article Deurbanising the web from January 2021. It argued that the web had gotten so bad that they wanted to do something drastic, so they converted the web pages on their site to PDF. The badness they were complaining about was familiar, too many ads, too much surveillance. Link rot, infinite scrolls, paywalls, GDPR cookie consent buttons, etc. The reason they chose PDFs?
Reasons why Lab6 argued PDFs were a good format for web pages it&amp;rsquo;s a file standard format still has media and links easy to copy and backup (avoids link rot and lost pages) freedom At first I was skeptical.</description>
