Journalists, video producers, musicians, and bloggers all have to pay their bills.&#xA;The two common ways of making money from online content are:&#xA;Free content with ads Subscription content without ads Sometimes publishers use both, but with a reduced number of ads for subscribers, magazine-style.&#xA;The trouble with subscriptions is that people can quickly feel saturated.
