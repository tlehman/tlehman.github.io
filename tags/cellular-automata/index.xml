      <description>John H. Conway has passed away, his contributions to math are too numerous for me to list in this post. What I wanted to explore in this post is one of his &amp;ldquo;recreational math&amp;rdquo; contributions: The Game of Life.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard, It&amp;rsquo;s this zero player computer &amp;ldquo;game&amp;rdquo;:   Not this multi-player board game:   I scare-quoted game because there are no actual players. It is an example of a cellular automaton, which is a simple program that evolves over time according to a fixed, simple set of rules.</description>
