      <description>The West Coast is on fire
This post is addressing the question of causality. When reading social media, I noticed three patterns:
 arguing about climate change and causality (e.g. climate change caused this and no-it-didn&amp;rsquo;t back and forth) rumors about the whole thing being caused by Antifa or Boog arsonists (multiple police departments have debunked this) dismissals based on &amp;lsquo;fires being natural&amp;rsquo;  The real cause of the fires is not a single cause.</description>
