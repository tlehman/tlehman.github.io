      <description>A new social media platform called Bluesky just launched. It has the look and feel of Twitter, but there&amp;rsquo;s something unique about it. It uses the AT Protocol. This is different from Mastodon, which is an open source Ruby on Rails app that provides some &amp;ldquo;instance to instance federation features&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;How Mastodon federation works, and why AT is different Anyone who wants to make a Mastodon instance just needs to check out a copy of the code and then deploy it with their own URL.</description>
