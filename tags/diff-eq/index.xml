      <description>Since a deadly virus appears to be spreading across the globe, I thought it would be useful to explore how this spread is modeled mathematically, and make some predictions about how quickly this can grow.&#xA;The simplest model of disease spreading starts by breaking a population up into compartments:&#xA;S (Susceptible) I (Infected) R (RemovedÔ∏è) Then, the model describes the flow between these compartments.&#xA;NOTE: This version of the model works over short periods and ignores births and natural deaths.</description>
