      <description>The story &amp;ldquo;The Tower of Babylon&amp;rdquo;, by Ted Chiang, is the first example of topological fiction I&amp;rsquo;ve come across that wasn&amp;rsquo;t obnoxiously about topology from the start. I&amp;rsquo;ve read fiction before, like Flatterland by Ian Stewart, that was styled after Edwin Abbot&amp;rsquo;s classic 1884 story, Flatland. Flatterland explores non-Euclidean geometry, fractal geometry, and topology, all using the classic Flatland tropes. I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with the genre. But Chiang&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Tower of Babylon&amp;rdquo; had the gravitas of a biblical story, with the subtlety of a proper piece of literature, and climaxed in the realization of a deep topological truth: that a world can be finite, but have no boundary.</description>
