      <title>Wildcard TLS Certificates for Your LAN</title>

      <description>for the impatient, skip to the how-to
This article explains how to get a TLS Certificate for your LAN so you can use https:// and not have to ignore these &amp;ldquo;⚠️ Your connection is not secure&amp;rdquo; errors:
  The reason that the browser throws this error is that TLS (and SSL before it) were designed to perform two functions:
 Authenticate the website to the user (prove it is really that site, and not a MITM) and Secure the contents of the data that flows between the user and the website  When you ignore this https error you are forgoing function #1, authentication, but you still get #2.</description>

      <title>Cybernetics in the Age of the Cloud</title>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s an old saying:
 There is no such thing as the cloud, there&amp;rsquo;s just someone else&amp;rsquo;s computer.
 That saying is true on the object level, a cloud provider is just a service that runs your app on a bunch of computers that belong to the service owner, like AWS or Google Cloud. But while it&amp;rsquo;s true that there isn&amp;rsquo;t a cloud there, it&amp;rsquo;s also true in the same way that there is no &amp;ldquo;computer&amp;rdquo; there.</description>

      <description>After 3.6 years at Amazon, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to move to another company to work on open source software. The company is SUSE, they make a Linux distribution and sell cloud computing services, among other things.
At Amazon I worked on AWS Elemental&amp;rsquo;s Live (video streaming software), a small video encoding device, and the Amazon Scout robotics project. At Scout I built software that controls the robots when autonomy fails, and I worked on safety features and performance optimization of a distributed application that ran on a cluster of servers managed by AWS Fargate.</description>
