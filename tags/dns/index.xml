      <description>for the impatient, skip to the how-to
This article explains how to get a TLS Certificate for your LAN so you can use https:// and not have to ignore these &amp;ldquo;⚠️ Your connection is not secure&amp;rdquo; errors:
The reason that the browser throws this error is that TLS (and SSL before it) were designed to perform two functions:
Authenticate the website to the user (prove it is really that site, and not a MITM) and Secure the contents of the data that flows between the user and the website When you ignore this https error you are forgoing function #1, authentication, but you still get #2.</description>

      <description>Today a DAO just distributed 1.5 billion dollars worth of ENS tokens. They were distributed to owners of .eth domains. DAO is short for &amp;ldquo;Decentralized Autonomous Organization&amp;rdquo;.
What is a DAO? A DAO is sort of like a corporation, but it&amp;rsquo;s stored on the Ethereum blockchain. Wyoming passed a DAO law that links on-chain DAOs to real corporations. The corporation that currently manages the Domain Name Service (DNS) is ICANN.</description>

      <description>In trying to understand DNS better, I stumbled upon this little bit of history in RFC 1034:
RFC 1034 Domain Concepts and Facilities November 1987
2.1. The history of domain names
The impetus for the development of the domain system was growth in the Internet: Host name to address mappings were maintained by the Network Information Center (NIC) in a single file (HOSTS.TXT) which was FTPed by all hosts [RFC-952, RFC-953].</description>
