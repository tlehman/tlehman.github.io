      <description>This book has two parts, one looks back and asks why flying cars never came to market, and the other looks forward to what possibilities lay ahead. The author has a background in chip design and nanotechnology, and even became a pilot so he could better evaluate the feasibility of flying car designs.&#xA;The autogyro, developed in the 1930s by Juan de la Cierva, was a promising candidate for a flying car.</description>
