      <title>Dapper Build tool: consistent builds with docker</title>

      <description>This articles shows how to use the dapper build tool from Rancher Labs.
The basic idea is to use Docker containers, copy* your source files into the container environment, then compile, then copy the build artefacts out.
(* on Linux you can also use the mount mode to avoid copying the files.)
How to use it: you start by installing Go so you can compile Dapper. I know, I know, but if you will humor me, I will convince you that Go is the last programming language compiler you will need to install on your host.</description>
