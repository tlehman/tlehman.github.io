      <description>The West Coast is on fire
This post is addressing the question of causality. When reading social media, I noticed three patterns:
 arguing about climate change and causality (e.g. climate change caused this and no-it-didn&amp;rsquo;t back and forth) rumors about the whole thing being caused by Antifa or Boog arsonists (multiple police departments have debunked this) dismissals based on &amp;lsquo;fires being natural&amp;rsquo;  The real cause of the fires is not a single cause.</description>

      <description>I think New Year is the best holiday, for two reasons. First, everyone celebrates it, and second, I love clocks rolling over. Something about numbers going up is really satisfying too (2020, it&amp;rsquo;s the highest year ever!). This New Year is also the start of a new decade, so I&amp;rsquo;m feeling more like reminiscing and want to wrap up the last decade into something like a sensible story I can file away in my memory.</description>
