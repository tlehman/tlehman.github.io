      <description>The year 2022 for me was good, better than I expected. The things I am most greatful for:&#xA;Our third child, first daughter, was born ❤️ I joined a great team at SUSE We sold our Renton house and bought our perfect house in Portland We met a family who adopted one of our rabbits, which lead to a cluster of amazing synchronicities that continue to surprise me The last part is symbolically appropriate going into 2023, which in the Chinese zodiac is the Year of the Rabbit.</description>
