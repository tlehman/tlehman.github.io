      <description>I want to share something that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for the last three months. Release 1.1.0-rc3 now has working PCI passthrough. Any PCI device in your cluster can now be passed through the hypervisor directly to a VM. This allows virtual machines to directly control a device, like a GPU, without any expensive virtualization layer in the way.&#xA;In the diagram above, the guest (VM) has direct memory access to the host&amp;rsquo;s memory for the device.</description>

      <description>After 3.6 years at Amazon, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to move to another company to work on open source software. The company is SUSE, they make a Linux distribution and sell cloud computing services, among other things.&#xA;At Amazon I worked on AWS Elemental&amp;rsquo;s Live (video streaming software), a small video encoding device, and the Amazon Scout robotics project. At Scout I built software that controls the robots when autonomy fails, and I worked on safety features and performance optimization of a distributed application that ran on a cluster of servers managed by AWS Fargate.</description>
