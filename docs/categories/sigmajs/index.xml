      <description>&lt;p&gt;Based on a comment by Mark Essel from &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/2012/10/14/unix-processes-and-their-parents/&#34;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; I have been trying
to add more metadata to the process tree. I have given up on doing it in a one-liner, so I started using bash scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, after a few hours of hacking bash, I got annoyed with the difficulty of very basic things such as incrementing
integers and dealing with collections, so I switched over to Ruby, with some minor shelling out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tlehman/procviz&#34;&gt;procviz&lt;/a&gt;, it is some ruby code for generating a graph representing
the process tree at the time &lt;code&gt;Graph.new&lt;/code&gt; is called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It generates DOT files just fine, but the images can get big if your system has a lot of stuff running. Also, the only
metadata I have attached to the nodes so far is the command name:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/images/blogimg/proc_with_names.png&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;/images/blogimg/proc_with_names.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make this into a more interactive visualization, but so far I have had a hard time getting Sigma.js or Arbor.js
to embed into this Octopress blog. I have been meaning to get a better understanding of javascript.&lt;/p&gt;
