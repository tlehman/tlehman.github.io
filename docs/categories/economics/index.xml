&lt;p&gt;Isabel Wilkerson&amp;rsquo;s riveting book about the Great Migration of African-Americans out of the south is the perfect blend of narrative and statisitcs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;float: right; width: 50%&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;/images/books/warmth_of_other_suns.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The personal stories of Ida Mae Brandon Gladney, George Swanson Starling and Robert Joseph Pershing Foster are the substantive bulk of the book. Around these personal stories are statistics that serve to add context and clarity to a movement that was so large, and took place over a long enough time, that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to miss it as a distinct historical period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book was my introduction to the Great Migration. It was a migration that began in 1915 with World War 1 and ended around 1970. Nearly 6 million African Americans left the South and traveled to cities in the North or the West, such as New York, Chicago, Baltimore, Cleveland, Los Angeles and Oakland. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a coordinated effort, it was the result of large economic and social forces, as well as millions of personal decisions to leave a part of the United States that historically had treated black people as property, and hadn&amp;rsquo;t improved much since the end of the civil war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several decades after the end of the civil war, even though slavery had been abolished, the old social order still existed, the same industries existed. Slavery had been replaced with the slightly less bad, but still quite terrible practice of sharecropping, where white planation owners would hire former slaves and children of former slaves as laborers. They usually took advantage of the fact that the black workers weren&amp;rsquo;t educated, effectively getting free or near-free labor. The de facto segregation that existed quickly became de jure segregation with the passing of Jim Crow laws in most southern states and counties. This began to change in a big way during World War 1, since the men that left for war in the north left a labor vacuum. Recruiters from the north would go south, trying to convince many black residents in the south to move north for jobs. This was just the beginning, since the family and friends of those first migrants kept that route in their minds as a possible option for a better life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book proceeds by moving through three parallel timelines, one of Ida Mae, a sharecropper&amp;rsquo;s wife from Missippi, who left in the 1930s. Then George Starling, a fruit picker from Florida, and finally Robert Foster, from Lousiana. The stories are told in parallel, but they all take place about a decade apart from one another. Wilkerson&amp;rsquo;s narrative style is so good, I sometimes felt like the stories were happening in the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between the personal stories were discussions relevant statistics, such as how many people had left which state, and incomes of black teachers and white teachers that were similarly qualified. The book does doesn&amp;rsquo;t just steep the reader in data, it moves briskly back into narrative and continues the unfolding saga of the three brave migrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two parts of the book that stood out most to me, one having to do with wealth inequality:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In neighboring Mississippi, white teachers and principals were making $630 a year, while the colored ones were paid a third of that-$215 a year, hardly more than field hands. But knowing that didn&amp;rsquo;t ease the burden of the Foster&amp;rsquo;s lives, get their children through college, or allow them to build assets to match their status and education.
The disparity in pay, reported without apology in the local papers for all to see, would have far-reaching effects. It would mean that the most promising of colored people, having received next to nothing in material assets from their slave foreparents, had to labor with the knowledge that they were now being underpaid by more than half, that they were so behind it would be all but impossible to accumulate the assets their white counterparts could, and that they would, by definition, have less to leave succeeding generations than similar white families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was followed by the long term consequences, which influence the world of today (2015):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiplied over the generations, it would mean a wealth deficit between the races that would require a miracle windfall or near aceticism on the part of colored families if they were to have any chance of catching up or amassing anything of value. Otherwise, the chasm would continue, as it did for blacks as a group even into the succeeding century. The layers of accumulated assets built up by the better-paid dominant caste, generation after generation, would factor into a wealth disparity of white Americans having an average net worth ten times that of black Americans by the turn of the twenty-first century, dampening the economic prospects of the children and grandchildren of the Great Migration before they were even born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This explanation clarified the concept of white privilege to me better than anything I&amp;rsquo;ve seen before, or since. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s gotten slightly worse since the turn of the century, a recent Pew Research study found that the average net worth of white families is thirteen times that of the average black family:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.pewresearch.org/files/2014/12/FT_14.12.11_wealthGap2.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other part that stood out to me was about automation and jobs, the story about &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_unemployment&#34;&gt;technological unemployment&lt;/a&gt; usually goes: &lt;em&gt;first a new technology emerges that makes some kind of human labor obsolete, and then those laborers lose their jobs, and get replaced by machines&lt;/em&gt;. While there are many examples of this, reality is much more complicated. Here&amp;rsquo;s the quote from the book related to this topic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took World War II and the even bigger outflow of blacks to awaken them to what some agricultural engineers working on a mechanical harvester already knew: &amp;ldquo;Much of this labor is not returning to the farm,&amp;rdquo; Harris P. Smith, the chief of agricultural engineering at Texas A&amp;amp;M University, wrote in 1946. &amp;ldquo;Therefore, the cotton farmer is forced to mechanize.&amp;rdquo; As for the connection between the Migration and the machine, Smith concluded that &amp;ldquo;instead of the machines displacing labor, they were used to replace the labor that had left the farm&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of cotton picking in the south, automation didn&amp;rsquo;t destroy jobs, it filled in a void of jobs that people willingly left. This aligns with my ideas about what kinds of work should be replaced by machines. Anything repetitive and degrading should be done by a machine. Humans are too important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is well worth your time, it is very informative, eye-opening, and incredibly well written.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why I uninstalled Adblock plus</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/11/23/why-i-uninstalled-adblock-plus/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The most common business models on the internet are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ad-supported free services (Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;freemium (reddit, Hulu, apps with in-app purchases, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;donation (Wikipedia, NPR, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;subscription (The Economist, Netflix, WSJ, NYTimes, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first type of business, the Google model, have been tremendously successful over the last 15 years or so. The users don&amp;rsquo;t have pay anything, and advertisers have a wealth of information to use to find better ways of serving ads. The obvious downside is that your activity is the product that is sold to the ad companies that partner with Google or Facebook. That information is also low-hanging fruit for government surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, people want convenient services for free, but companies like Google and Facebook have enormous data centers and expensive engineers to pay for. So we have ads, it&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable tradeoff. I want free stuff too, but I understand that it will mean ads targeted at me, well-informed by my online activity. Many people don&amp;rsquo;t understand this tradeoff, and just think Google and Facebook magically work and keep their information private. The obvious solution if you want your online information private is to pay for services that don&amp;rsquo;t have to sell your information to advertisers. Another is to buy your own servers and host things yourself, and learn enough about cryptography to be able to keep it secure. Either way, it will cost money, since you are no longer benefiting from those ad-based subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I hate almost all ads, but I understand why they are there, because I&amp;rsquo;m using Gmail, GovTrack, Twitter, etc. using up server resources without paying for it. For a long time, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the Adblock plus browser plugin, and it blocks ads so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to look at them. About three months ago I changed my mind though, and it had to do with the reason I think voting is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-we-should-all-vote&#34;&gt;Why we should all vote&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thought process was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My individual vote will &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/probdecisive2.pdf&#34;&gt;almost certainly not change the outcome of an election&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am equivalent to all citizens in terms of rights and responsibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the population needs to vote in order for the policies and politicians to approximately represent us voters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear that (3) is an extreme hypothetical, but it&amp;rsquo;s an important ideal to use when deciding how to behave as a civilized human (Kant called this the Categorical Imperative). From (2), I can conclude that if I am going to decide to do something, I need to consistently apply my reasoning to the whole population. Finally, if I use (1) to justify not voting, it follows by (2) that each citizen should not bother voting. If every citizen then decided not to vote, democracy wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work. Therefore, I will vote, an encourage others to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does voting have to do with Adblock?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-we-should-all-uninstall-adblock&#34;&gt;Why we should all uninstall adblock&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I see a related issue behind adblock and voting is that services like Gmail, Facebook and GovTrack require that most of their users see those ads, and occasionally follow them. And each individual user decides that they don&amp;rsquo;t want to look at ads, and that their own attempt to block ads aren&amp;rsquo;t going to bankrupt the companies behind them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thought process behind it is very similiar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My individual installation of adblock will almost certainly not bankrupt the company behind the site I&amp;rsquo;m using.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am equivalent to all users of the software service who are using it free of charge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the userbase needs to see and interact with ads in order for the company to make money and continue existing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The similarity should be clear now. I personally don&amp;rsquo;t want ads, but I understand that if all Gmail and Facebook users blocked ads, Google and Facebook would have to change their services to a subscription model, and users would have to pay money to use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either uninstall adblock (or whatever is used to block ads), or start paying. I was pleased to hear that Google is offering &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/google-launches-subscription-service-for-the-internet-to-replace-ad-revenue-online-9874758.html&#34;&gt;an alternative to ads&lt;/a&gt; where you pay a small monthly fee to have a totally ad-free Google experience. If you are on the internet, you are paying for electricity and the connection itself, so you can pay for the services you use. Otherwise, live with ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: My site doesn&amp;rsquo;t have ads, nor does it cost to read it, it&amp;rsquo;s closer to a donation model, I pay a small fee to host the site, and I don&amp;rsquo;t expect people to pay me for it. However, it&amp;rsquo;s static content, so most of the computational work happens on the client site (handled by your browser). I do have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://onename.io/tlehman&#34;&gt;bitcoin donation address&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gini Coefficient and Income Distribution</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/08/31/gini-coefficient-and-income-distribution/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/blog/2014/08/31/gini-coefficient-and-income-distribution/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The gini coefficient is a measure of income inequality. It is calculated by ordering the given population by income, then calculating the cumulative distribution, and finding out how much it deviates from total equality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for example, assume there are four people, and everyone makes the exact same amount:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/blogimg/gini/equal_hist.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the cumulative distribution just sums the values to the left, so for this hypothetical equal society of four, the cumulative distribution would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/blogimg/gini/equal_cumulative.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as you can see, the cumulative distribution would be a straight line. The gini coefficient is calculated as two times the area of the difference between this straight line and the actual distribution. Since in this hypothetical world, the distribution is totally equal, it follows that the gini coefficient is 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way to read the gini coefficient is that 0 is totally equal, and 1 is totally unequal. In the totally unequal case, one person would make everything, and everyone else would make nothing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/blogimg/gini/unequal_cumulative.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is probably obvious at this point, the gini coefficient can be any real number between 0 and 1, with lower meaning more equal, and higher meaning less equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, reality is always more interesting (and messier). The real world gini coefficient in 2014 of the United States 0.42, and Switzerland is 0.31&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By modeling the cumulative distribution function as a power, such as x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, you can find an n that reproduces the same gini coefficient:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% img /images/blogimg/gini/gini_us_ch.png %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the United States had a gini coefficient of 0.42, which corresponds to a distribution curve that is about x&lt;sup&gt;2.45&lt;/sup&gt;, by contrast, Switzerland has a gini coefficient of 0.31, which corresponds to a distribution curve that is about x&lt;sup&gt;1.9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that the cumulative distribution function is most likely not a simple power, but this shape does give a decent guess at what the respective distributions might look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the gini coefficient says nothing about the absolute standard of living, meaning that a rich country and a poor country could have the same gini coefficient. For example, Norway and Czech Republic both have a gini coefficient of about 0.25, but Norway&amp;rsquo;s GDP per capita is about 5 times more than Czech Republic&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these limitations, the gini coefficient is a useful number for getting an idea about how income is distributed in a given population.&lt;/p&gt;
