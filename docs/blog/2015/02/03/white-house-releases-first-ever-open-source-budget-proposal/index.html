			<h1>White House releases first ever open source budget proposal</h1>
			<div>
				<p>The White House just released the <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/2016-budget-data">first ever open source budget proposal</a>. It is released on GitHub, and it&rsquo;s a bunch of CSV files. This is not very difficult, it requires only a few extra clicks when exporting an Excel spreadsheet, but hosting it on GitHub also opens it up to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">Pull Requests</a>, which I&rsquo;ve <a href="/blog/2013/09/14/viewing-nsa-accountability-act-amendments-as-a-diff/">talked about before</a> as being a much better tool for 21st century democracy. Instead of paper and a bunch of politicians in a room following procedure, we should intead have a digital system where all citizens can contribute as easily as they can update a facebook status or apply an instagram filter.</p>

<p>One huge caveat is in order though: there is no reason to assume that the White House and Congress will even consider pull requests, let alone apply them. This aside, I will experiment with this, I&rsquo;ve already modified <a href="https://github.com/dinedal/textql/pull/39">textql</a> so that I can easily query these CSV files from a SQLite database. If I have an idea about how I&rsquo;d like to change the budget, I&rsquo;ll submit the pull request and then follow it&rsquo;s response, if any.</p>

<p>Caveats aside, I am impressed with the choice of technologies for making these public issues more accessible.</p>
