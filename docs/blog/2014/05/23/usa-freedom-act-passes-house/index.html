			<h1>USA FREEDOM Act passes house</h1>
			<div>
				<p>About 9 months ago I wrote about <a href="/blog/2013/08/13/an-unbalance-of-powers/">NSA bulk spying and how the way the FISA court is being used upsets the balance of powers in the government</a>, the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr2586">two</a> <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr2761">bills</a> I referenced have a 4% and 2% chance of being enacted, according to GovTrack. Both of those bills still haven&rsquo;t left the House, and chances are they won&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>A more promising bill is the USA FREEDOM Act, which just passed the House:</p>

<script id="govtrack:widget:bill:113:hr3361:script" src="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr3361/widget.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

<p>Unforunately, Rep. Justin Amash noted that the changes to it are so bad, that most of the original co-sponsors are out:</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Just how bad were changes to <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23USAFREEDOMAct&amp;src=hash">#USAFREEDOMAct</a>? MAJORITY of 152 cosponsors voted NO. Roll call: <a href="http://t.co/2kaG5hrmw1">http://t.co/2kaG5hrmw1</a> <a href="http://t.co/13gUpANOEN">http://t.co/13gUpANOEN</a></p>&mdash; Justin Amash (@repjustinamash) <a href="https://twitter.com/repjustinamash/statuses/469883039125106689">May 23, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>Also, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/05/eff-dismayed-houses-gutted-usa-freedom-act">EFF doesn&rsquo;t approve</a>. Fortunately, Sen. Patrick Leahy said he intends on <a href="https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/comment-of-senator-patrick-leahy-d-vt_chairman-senate-judiciary-committee-on-house-passage-of-the-usa-freedom-act-">fixing a lot of those problems in the Senate version of the bill</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to get cynical and fatalistic about the erosion of civil liberties and the problems in government, but recognizing the problems and paying attention, putting pressure on congress can make a difference. Stay rational and contact your <a href="http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/">representative</a> and <a href="https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm">senators</a>.</p>

<p>Remember that the Congress is the most powerful branch of government, it makes and destroys laws, with or without the President&rsquo;s consent (1). Each and every member of congress cares about what we citizens think, because they wish to be re-elected, and we elect them. They are more accesible than you might think.</p>

<p>(1) Even if the President vetos a bill, Congress can still override with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#United_States"><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> supermajority in both houses</a></p>
