			<h1>Visualizing the &#39;belongs to&#39; relation in rails app models</h1>
			<div>
				<p>When working on rails apps, I usually have to make a mental map of the models and how they interrelate.</p>

<p>An Active Record model can belong to another, but when you have more than half a dozen models, keeping all
the belongs_to relations in mind quickly becomes impossible. As a solution to this, I made a command line
program called <a href="https://github.com/tlehman/bin#argraph">argraph</a>, for &lsquo;ActiveRecord graph&rsquo;, it produces a digraph in the
<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html">DOT language</a>, which can be rendered as an image
using <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">GraphViz</a>.</p>

<p>The nodes are models, and the edges are the &lsquo;belongs to&rsquo; relation.</p>

<p>The way to use it is to check it out or fork my <a href="https://github.com/tlehman/bin">bin</a> repo, make sure that directory
is in your PATH variable, cd to the root of your rails app and run <code>argraph</code>.</p>

<p>As an example, suppose you have the <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse">discourse</a> rails app checked out,
and you want to find out how some of it&rsquo;s models are interrelated:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd discourse
$ argraph Post Topic Category PostReply User UserAction UserHistory QuotedPost View UserAvatar
digraph {
 Post -&gt; User
 Post -&gt; Topic
 Topic -&gt; Category
 Topic -&gt; User
 Category -&gt; Topic
 Category -&gt; User
 PostReply -&gt; Post
 UserAction -&gt; User
 QuotedPost -&gt; Post
 QuotedPost -&gt; QuotedPost
 View -&gt; User
 UserAvatar -&gt; User
}
$ !! | dot -Tpng &gt; discourse.png
</code></pre>

<p>The above graph renders as:
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YQOyHUn.png" alt="discourse model graph" /></p>

<p>You can also run the command with no arguments, in which case it maps out all models, but on bigger apps, this can be hard to follow,
so I found it useful to be able to explore subgraphs containing more models than my memory could fit, but not so many that the image
was polluted and hard to follow.</p>
