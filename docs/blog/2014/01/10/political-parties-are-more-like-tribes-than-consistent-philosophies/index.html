			<h1>Political parties are more like tribes than consistent philosophies</h1>
			<div>
				<p>Much of political opinion is rationalized groupthink, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/01/10/the-depressing-psychological-theory-that-explains-washington/">this article</a> argues this by using a list of 5 political proposals written from a <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/five-economic-reforms-millennials-should-be-fighting-for-20140103#ixzz2pMmIpUzc">liberal viewpoint</a>, and then re-written <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/01/07/five-conservative-reforms-millennials-should-be-fighting-for/">from a conservative viewpoint</a>, the results are telling.</p>

<p>No substantive policy change occurred, but many liberals supported the liberal-flavored list, while many conservatives rejected it. When the conservative-flavored version was written (same exact policies), that divide was inverted.</p>

<p>The response suggests that most people judged it based on how it was framed, and in particular, whether it was their group or the other group endorsed the idea. This is a good reason that political parties should be abolished, or at least worked around.</p>

<p>This could be solved by sterilizing ballots. Instead of seeing a candidate&rsquo;s name, party, or see who endorsed what policy, several equivalent voting ballots could be written by different people. This would require that the candidate&rsquo;s name is replaced with some other unique identifier, say a CIN (Candidate Identification Number). The CIN could be paired with a list of policies, each of which have been re-written by neutral parties (perhaps a machine compiled them from some computer model). Then, people would answer a questionairre about which policies they supported the most, along with a weight, assigned by the voter. Then, a program could calculate the closest match, and that would be the person&rsquo;s vote.</p>

<p>One obvious problem with my proposal is that if the software that calculated the closest match was closed source, it would be very easy for software developers to rig it one way or another. Two solutions come to mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make the voting software open source and submit it to a peer-review</li>
<li>Give the voter instructions on how to calculate the closest match, so that they can do it themselves, manually.</li>
</ul>

<p>The options of using software or going manual are not mutually exclusive either. This is how people in the United States do their taxes, some delegate the calculations to software like TaxHawk or TurboTax, and some do it themselves with a calculator.</p>

<p>This proposal would solve the problem of tribal thinking in politics, and make voting a more logical activity that really did reflect the needs of the public.</p>

<p>I wrote about a <a href="http://tobilehman.com/blog/2012/09/04/optimize-your-vote-using-statistics/">similiar idea in 2012 to solve the problem of choosing the candidate you disliked the least</a>,</p>

<p>Making people register with parties and then vote only exacerbates this, because they&rsquo;ve made a commitment to a tribe before they&rsquo;ve made a decision.</p>
