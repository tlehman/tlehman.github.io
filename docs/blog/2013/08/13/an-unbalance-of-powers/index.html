			<h1>An unbalance of powers</h1>
			<div>
				<p>About three months ago I wrote about the <a href="/blog/2013/05/10/white-house-open-data-policy/">White House Open Data Policy and the balance of the three main branches of government</a>. This was shortly before the new evidence of the <a href="https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying/timeline">far-reaching NSA domestic surveillance programs</a> was revealed by Edward Snowden.</p>

<p>What is interesting (and unsettling) about all the NSA&rsquo;s surveillance activity is that it is authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court), which is effectively a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/us/in-secret-court-vastly-broadens-powers-of-nsa.html?_r=0">parallel Supreme Court</a> that operates in secret.</p>

<p>{% img /images/blogimg/fisa_gov.png %}</p>

<p>I was somewhat naive to think that there was such a balance of powers. Right now, there is little visibility into what decisions the FISA Court makes, how they came to those decisions, and what that means for U.S. Citizens.</p>

<p>There are several bills moving through congress that are aimed at fixing this lack of balance. One that looks promising is H.R. 2586: FISA Court Accountability Act, which amends FISA to let congress designate FISA Court judges, and require the FISA court submit &ldquo;an unclassified summary of each such decision, order, or opinion&rdquo; to congress:</p>

<p>Another is H.R. 2761: Presidential Appointment of FISA Court Judges Act, which will &ldquo;require Presidential appointment and Senate confirmation of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judges&rdquo;:</p>

<script id="govtrack:widget:bill:113:hr2761:script" src="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr2761/widget.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

<p>I will be watching the progress of these bills closely, I don&rsquo;t accept that there should exist a body of secret law that has a direct impact on the citizens of the United States.</p>
