			<h1>Reinventing the wheel: Or how I learned to stop coding and read the manpages</h1>
			<div>
				<p>About a month ago I <a href="/blog/2012/12/30/building-command-line-utilities-in-ruby-that-play-well-with-the-rest-of-the-unix-utilities/">wrote about a command line utility</a> I made that calculates word and character frequencies. It was packaged as a ruby gem and it interacted well with the Unix pipeline interface.</p>

<p>Then, about 2 or 3 weeks later, I come across this post on Twitter:</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Show how many times each line in a sorted file is repeated: uniq -c</p>&mdash; Unix tool tip (@UnixToolTip) <a href="https://twitter.com/UnixToolTip/status/292295351518498816">January 18, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And I realized that I could construct a one-liner that does what my gem did. Probably faster too. I know about uniq and sort, and I&rsquo;ve used awk a little bit, but am not really familiar with most of it&rsquo;s capabilities.</p>

<p>The two features I implemented in ruby were (1) counting word frequencies and (2) counting character frequencies. I defaulted everything to lower case and stripped out non-alphanumeric characters.</p>

<p>Using @UnixToolTip&rsquo;s suggestion of <code>uniq -c</code>, I came up with this alternative:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">for word in $(cat filename); do echo $word; done | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9]//g' | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
</code></pre>

<p>This just outputs the file, splits everything up by whitespace, strips out anything that isn&rsquo;t alphanumeric, then lowercases, sorts, and counts the number of repetitions using <code>uniq -c</code>. The result of that is then sorted numerically, to get the most frequent items at the top of the output, and then displays just the top 10 lines using <code>head</code>. There are some small numerical differences between this and my gem, and that is most likely because I split by word boundary in ruby, but split by whitespace on the bash one-liner.</p>

<p>For the problem I was trying to solve, I could have saved some time by digging through the manpages instead of writing another gem. I did enjoy working with the Rubygems packaging system, but I am starting to think that was overkill.</p>

<p>NOTE: For the character count feature, all I have to do is output one character per line, then I can insert that into the pipeline to get the desired output:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">(CONTENTS OF FILENAME, 1 CHARACTER PER LINE) | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9]//g' | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how to do this at the moment, I think <code>awk</code> can do it pretty simply, I&rsquo;ll read the manpages, but for now I have to get to work.</p>
