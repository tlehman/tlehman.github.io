			<h1>Euclid&#39;s Algorithm in MIX assembly language vs Scheme</h1>
			<div>
				<p>I wrote my first assembly language program today, it was written in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIX">Donald Knuth&rsquo;s MIX Assembly
Language</a>. Technically I&rsquo;ve written
some x86 assembly in a class in 2009, but it doesn&rsquo;t count, it wasn&rsquo;t
a complete program, and I barely understood it.</p>

<p>It is an implementation of Euclid&rsquo;s Algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor of two
positive integers. Writing in an assembly language is so much more
work than writing in a high-level language like Ruby, Scheme or even
C. However, it gives a much better idea of how the computer actually
works, and gives the programmer much more appreciation for all the
nice abstractions we use in our day jobs and side projects.</p>

<p>The algorithm is the first example mentioned in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming">The Art of Computer Programming</a>.
I found that just reading the algorithm
alone doesn&rsquo;t give much insight as to why it works, but reviewing a
little bit of discrete math first, one can see where the steps come
from.</p>

<p>First, start by assuming that m and n are positive integers, with m &gt;
n, and then the greatest common divisor d is the unique smallest integer such that:</p>

<p>{% latex %}
  $ \exists a,b \in \mathbb{Z} : am + bn = d  $
{% endlatex %}</p>

<p>Then, let r = m mod n (the remainder of m divided by n), we will prove
that</p>

<p>{% latex %}
  $ \gcd(m,n) = \gcd(n,r) $
{% endlatex %}</p>

<p>All we need to show is that there are integers s and t such that</p>

<p>{% latex %}
  $ sn + tr = d  $
{% endlatex %}</p>

<p>Note that since r = m mod n, it follows that r - m is a multiple of n,
this means:</p>

<p>{% latex %}
  $ \exists k \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ such that }  r-m = kn $
{% endlatex %}</p>

<p>Now, we take the integers a,b in the definition of gcd(m,n) above and
add -ar to both sides of the equation:</p>

<p>{% latex %}
\begin{align}
   am + bn &amp; = d \newline
\ am - ar + bn &amp; = d - ar<br />
\ a(m - r) + bn &amp; = d - ar
\ kn + bn &amp; = d - ar<br />
\ (k + b)n &amp; = d - ar<br />
\ (k + b)n + ar &amp; = d<br />
\end{align}</p>

<p>{% endlatex %}</p>

<p>It is clear from the last equation above that s = (k+b) and t = a,
which completes the proof.</p>

<p>Since gcd(m,n)=gcd(n,r), and r has the property that 0 &le; r &lt; n,
we can reduce the problem to a smaller problem, and since the previous
inequality always holds, it follows that r will eventually be 0, in
which case n is the greatest common divisor.</p>

<p>This recursive form is very naturally captured in Scheme,
Here&rsquo;s the Scheme version (problem 2.01 in SICP):</p>

<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define (gcd m n)
  (if (= n 0)
      m
      (gcd n (remainder m n))))
</code></pre>

<p>To implement the same algorithm in MIX assembly language, we need to
use much more primitive concepts. Firstly, we designate the X register
to hold the value of m, the I1 register to hold the value of n, and
proceed using the <code>DIV</code> operation to find the remainder.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the MIX assembly language version:</p>

<pre><code>PRNT  EQU	19	* Typewriter terminal, stdout in MDK (GNU Mix Development Kit)
DVSR  EQU	100	* store n for DIV operation
SWAP  EQU	101	* swap to handle reg-to-reg transfers (inefficient)
START ENTA	0
      ENTX	165
      ENT1	90
E1    ST1	DVSR	* store n in DVSR
      DIV	DVSR	* rA &lt;- m//n; rX &lt;- m%n
E2    CMPX	=0=
      JE	QUIT	* halt if r=0, then CONTENTS(DVSOR)=gcd(m,n)
E3    STX	SWAP
      LD1	SWAP	* n &lt;- r
      LDX	DVSR	* m &lt;- n
      ENTA	0
      JMP	E1	* go to E1
QUIT  LDA	DVSR    * rA &lt;- gcd(m,n)
      CHAR	0       * convert rA to character code
      STX	DVSR	* store least significant digits in DVSR cell
      OUT	DVSR(PRNT)
      HLT
      END	START
</code></pre>

<p>I came up with the above code as an exercise in in MIX Assembly
Language so that I could better understand the algorithms in the book.
I have a hunch that it is not as efficient as it could be. I do a lot of
swapping from registers to memory and back. Although to be fair, I
couldn&rsquo;t find a way to transfer data from a register to any of the other
registers (kind of like the <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/Data_Transfer#Move">MOV instruction in x86</a> ),
if someone knows of a way to do this, please correct me in
the comments, I would like to know.</p>
