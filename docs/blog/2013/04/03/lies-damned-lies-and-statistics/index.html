			<h1>Lies Damned Lies and Statistics</h1>
			<div>
				<p>There is a quote, usually attributed to Mark Twain that goes something
like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There are three kinds lies.
Lies, Damned Lies, and Statistics.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My interpretation of this is that statistics are supposed to be the
worst kind of lie, or that the worst kinds of lies use
statistics.</p>

<p>The thing that bothers me most about this quote (and the innumerable
minor variations of it that get repeated) is that the word
&lsquo;statistics&rsquo; comes at the end.</p>

<p>Why does that matter? Notice that the list is presented as a sequence,
an increasing sequence of damned-ness, and the presence of the word
&lsquo;statistics&rsquo; at the end is supposed to imply that it is &lsquo;more damned&rsquo;
than damned lies.</p>

<p>This interpretation bothers me because the implied damned-ness is
based on the initial correlation, and that correlation is only based
on two data points. The quote depends on a misunderstanding of
statistics. Anyone who has studied a little bit of statistics will
know not to trust an inference based on a correlation in a data set
of only two points!</p>
