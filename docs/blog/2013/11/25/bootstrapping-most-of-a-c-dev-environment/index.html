			<h1>Bootstrapping most of a C dev environment</h1>
			<div>
				<p>I&rsquo;ve taken a break from SICP and TAOCP in order to get a good foundation in the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CeeLanguage">C programming language</a>, I&rsquo;m familiar with it, but that is not good enough. The reason is because C exposes a lot more about how the computer works, understanding it is an important first step in understanding computers. Steve Yegge said it well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You just have to know C. Why? Because for all practical purposes, every computer in the world you&rsquo;ll ever use is a von Neumann machine, and C is a lightweight, expressive syntax for the von Neumann machine&rsquo;s capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The SICP world-view is from a parallel world of computing that grew from John McCarthy&rsquo;s LISP. There were even alternatives to the von Neumann architecture (Lisp Machines) that were built, which natively ran Lisp.</p>

<p>In the interest of <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ToGrok">grokking</a> computers (not just knowing how to put them together, configure and run scripts on them), I should really know C.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started with the basic command line tools:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>cat(1)</code></li>
<li><code>grep(1)</code></li>
<li><code>ls(1)</code></li>
<li><code>wc(1)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Note: <code>foo(n)</code> means that the command <code>foo</code> is on manpage section <code>n</code>, to view the manpage, type <code>man n foo</code>.</p>

<p>For <code>cat(1)</code>, it was a simple matter of using <code>read(2)</code> and <code>write(2)</code>, the only tricky thing is getting familiar with IO buffering, but other than that it&rsquo;s trivial. After having written these tools, I&rsquo;ve been using them to work on this code, so I would use my own <code>cat</code> and my own <code>grep</code> and <code>wc</code> inspect the code I had just written, it was very rewarding.</p>

<p>From there I decided I should go further and write an editor, I researched to find the simplest editor that was common on Unix-like systems. I didn&rsquo;t have to look far to find <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?EdIsTheStandardTextEditor">ed</a>, it is a line-based editor, and after spending 30 minutes learning how to use it, I found the commands similar vi or vim, except that I had to imagine the text, I couldn&rsquo;t see it as I typed. Then I&rsquo;ll need a shell, then a C compiler, then an operating system.</p>

<p>I can probably handle a shell, but I&rsquo;ll need to study a lot more before I put together a compiler and operating system.</p>

<p>My long term goal is to be able to write a whole develpment environment from scratch. Since Unix-like systems are built from small pieces, it makes it reasonably feasible to do it piece by piece.</p>
