			<h1>Spaces in filenames</h1>
			<div>
				<p>I don&rsquo;t like spaces in filenames. This trend started when I started playing with the command line on Linux
back when I was about 13. Working with the shell, each space had to be escaped, which is just enough of an
annoyance to warrant avoiding spaces altogether as a basic principle.</p>

<p>I got to thinking about this recently when I tried to find out how I could get rid of the space in the name
of my Google Drive directory. I use both Dropbox and Google Drive, and as a package, I prefer Dropbox because
of their out-of-the-box Linux support. However, Google Drive allows for a smaller per-month charge, and at the
time of this post, the cost per byte is about the same between the two. Also, when you install Dropbox, you
don&rsquo;t have a stupid space in the middle of the directory name!</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, I did a little experiment to find out how steadfastly I had been applying my own principle:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">~ &gt; find Dropbox | wc -l
    9909
~ &gt; find Dropbox | grep &quot; &quot; | wc -l
     834
~ &gt; python -c &quot;print(834.0/9909.0)&quot;
0.084165909779
</code></pre>

<p>So, 8.4% of my file and directory names have spaces in them. Apparently, my four years of dropbox usage have
been rather unprincipled.</p>

<p>Performing the same experiment on the Google Drive directory requires an extra step, since &ldquo;Google Drive&rdquo; is
the name of the root directory, I had to shave off that part using sed:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">~ &gt; find Google\ Drive | sed 's/Google Drive\///g' | wc -l
    2263
~ &gt; find Google\ Drive | sed 's/Google Drive\///g' | grep &quot; &quot; | wc -l
      68
~ &gt; python -c &quot;print(68.0/2263.0)&quot;
0.0300486080424
</code></pre>

<p>So, correcting for the root directory&rsquo;s name, only 3% of the stuff in my Google Drive have spaces in the name.</p>

<p>In practice, I only follow this principle about 92-97% of the time, I can improve on that with a simple script,
once I have it made, I&rsquo;ll post it for others who agree about how files should be named.</p>
