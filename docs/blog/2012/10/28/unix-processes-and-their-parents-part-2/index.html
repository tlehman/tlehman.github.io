			<h1>Unix Processes and Their Parents Part 2</h1>
			<div>
				<p>Based on a comment by Mark Essel from <a href="/blog/2012/10/14/unix-processes-and-their-parents/">part 1</a> I have been trying
to add more metadata to the process tree. I have given up on doing it in a one-liner, so I started using bash scripts.</p>

<p>Then, after a few hours of hacking bash, I got annoyed with the difficulty of very basic things such as incrementing
integers and dealing with collections, so I switched over to Ruby, with some minor shelling out.</p>

<p>The result is <a href="https://github.com/tlehman/procviz">procviz</a>, it is some ruby code for generating a graph representing
the process tree at the time <code>Graph.new</code> is called.</p>

<p>It generates DOT files just fine, but the images can get big if your system has a lot of stuff running. Also, the only
metadata I have attached to the nodes so far is the command name:</p>

</a></p>

<p>I wanted to make this into a more interactive visualization, but so far I have had a hard time getting Sigma.js or Arbor.js
to embed into this Octopress blog. I have been meaning to get a better understanding of javascript.</p>
