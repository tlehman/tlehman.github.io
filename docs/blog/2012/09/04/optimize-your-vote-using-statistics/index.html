			<h1>Optimize your vote using statistics</h1>
			<div>
				<p>I used to hate the phrase &ldquo;throwing your vote away.&rdquo;. This is usually
used in response to people voting for someone who is probably not going
to win. Even though we have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_the_United_States#Major_political_parties">five major parties</a> in the United States, chances are, the winner is going to either a Republican or a Democrat.</p>

<p>The reason I hated that phrase so much is that it discourages people
from voting for their ideal candidate for pragmatic reasons. Chances
are, a non-Democrat, non-Republican is not going to win, so cut your
losses and pick a candidate that you <em>dislike least</em>.</p>

<p>However, as I&rsquo;ve gotten slightly older, I have come to appreciate how
necessary compromise is. What has me more hopeful is that you can
compromise with precision. I&rsquo;ll explain what I mean by first giving some
context.</p>

<p>Scott Hanselman <a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/243032228655951872">mentioned this site on twitter today</a> called <a href="http://isidewith.com">isidewith.com</a>. It asks you a series of questions about issues that frequently arise in political debates. It then asks you to rate the importance of the issues, and then gives you a list of the percent with which you agree with all the candidates running for Present in 2012.</p>

<p>So, you can choose your ideal candidate based on how many issues you agree on. For example, I answered the questions and got this as a match:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gary Johnson 83%</li>
<li>Jill Stein 82%</li>
<li>Barack Obama 81%</li>
<li>Mitt Romney 31%</li>
</ul>

<p>From these results, it looks like a very close call between Johnson,
Stein and Obama. Based on these results, my ideal candidate is probably
one of these three.</p>

<p>So here is where we can compromise with precision, since I have three
almost identical matches (with respect to the battery of questions I
answered about various political issues). I can now decide which of
these three to vote on based on the likelihood they will win.</p>

<p>The original reason I was so bothered by this is was that I thought that
ideals determined <em>one and only one</em> ideal candidate. But by letting
data about the issues determine which candidates were ideal, I
allow for the possibility of multiple near-ideal matches.</p>

<p>Then, given the set of near ideal matches, I can take into account which
is most likely to win, and cast my vote accordingly.</p>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s get to some statistics, since my title promised it, and
because we can use this to actually calculate who you should vote for.
In fact, if a good enough model can be generated to this effect, perhaps
we could replace voting for a single individual with taking a test, and
having a computer calculate your vote for you. That would be a much
better way to have the candidate reflect the majority views in the
United States.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with some definitions, the <strong>expected value</strong> of a random
variable X, where X can take on any of the n values {x<sub>1</sub>, &hellip; x<sub>n</sub>}
with corresponding probabilities {p<sub>1</sub>, &hellip; p<sub>n</sub>}, is
just the sum of those probabilities, times the corresponding value:</p>

<p>{% latex %}
  $ E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n p_ix_i $
{% endlatex %}</p>

<p>So the expected value is a sort of weighted average over all of the
values the random variable could take on. The part of this I will be
using is the p<sub>i</sub> factor. Given this definition, there
naturally follows an &ldquo;expected maximum&rdquo;, denoted Emax(X).</p>

<p>{% latex %}
  $ Emax(X) = \max{ p_ix<em>i }</em>{i=1}^n $
{% endlatex %}</p>

<p>I make a further modification to
this model and use the <strong>issues coefficient</strong> c<sub>i</sub>. For example, I was an 83% match with Gary Johnson, so if Johnson is represented by the value x<sub>i</sub>, then c<sub>i</sub> = 0.83.</p>

<p>So, using this model we have two values that need to be accounted
for before we can decide who to vote for, there is p<sub>i</sub>, which is the probability that the i-th candidate will win, and then there is c<sub>i</sub>, the degree to which the voter agrees with the candidate on the relevant issues. Since we don&rsquo;t know who is going to win, we set all x<sub>i</sub> = 1, and we can ignore that altogether, so the expected maximum becomes:</p>

<p>{% latex %}
  $ Emax(X) = \max{ c_ip<em>i }</em>{i=1}^n $
{% endlatex %}</p>

<p>Now, in my case, I have all of the four c<sub>i</sub> values, but I don&rsquo;t
have the p<sub>i</sub> values. To find these values, we could start with
the number of electoral representatives per party. I have not been able to find
this data, but If I did, I could calculate the perfect choice of a vote,
one that would be balanced between idealism and pragmatism.</p>

<p>Note: If any of you can find data on the number of electoral
representatives per political party, I will happily make this into an
app that will calculate a suggestion based on this model. It will take
your <a href="http://isidewith.com">isidewith.com</a> data and then weigh that with
the proportion of electoral votes for the corresponding party.</p>
