			<h1>Simplifying client-side web development with Angular.js</h1>
			<div>
				<p>For dealing with client-side web development there are a lot of ways to bind data to elements to HTML. However, none have stood out quite as well as <a href="http://angular.js">Angular.js</a> from Google. There is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFTFsKmkQnQ&amp;feature=player_embedded">good screencast</a> giving a side-by-side comparison of a &ldquo;hello name&rdquo; app done in jQuery and then in Angular.</p>

<p>I have been meaning to play around with this library for a while, but I didn&rsquo;t have any unique ways of applying it. However, just today, my girlfriend suggested that we try to Latinize our names, similar to how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> did. I thought it was a cool idea, and assumed that someone had already made an app that did just that. It turns out that no one has, however, I did find <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_7378149_convert-english-first-name-latin.html">this article</a> on ehow.com on how to turn an english first name to Latin. The rules are simple, but instead of spelling them out here, I&rsquo;m going to link to the app that I made, and then dissect it. The dissection will show a little bit of Angular.js in action.</p>

<p><a href="/apps/latinizer" target="_new">Heres the app.</a></p>

<p>This app had to respond to the events triggered by changing the text in the text box, and also to the changing radio button. If I was using something like jQuery, I&rsquo;d have to rig up handlers for all those events. Also, any time the name or the gender changes, I&rsquo;d have to update the label that displayed the latinized name. This is not hard, but it does get tedious, especially for larger apps.</p>

<p>The way Angular handles this is by abstracting away all of the event handling, and making it so that the developer (me) can just bind a label to an object, and then bind controls to an object, and trigger all the updates automatically.</p>

<p>Using the Latinizer example, let&rsquo;s start with the view:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html ng-app&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;http://code.angularjs.org/angular-1.0.1.min.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;latinizer.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Convert English name into Latin&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div ng-controller=&quot;LatinizerCtrl&quot;&gt;
        &lt;label&gt;First Name:&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; ng-model=&quot;person.firstName&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter First Name&quot;&gt;
        &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; name=&quot;gender&quot; value=&quot;Male&quot; ng-model=&quot;person.gender&quot;&gt;Male
        &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; name=&quot;gender&quot; value=&quot;Female&quot; ng-model=&quot;person.gender&quot;&gt;Female
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;{{latinizeFirstName(person)}}&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    Note: the rules being used here are from 
		&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ehow.com/how_7378149_convert-english-first-name-latin.html&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is just an ordinary html file that includes the angular.js library, and some of the elements have &ldquo;ng-something&rdquo; attributes. Those attributes tell angular where to get and set data.</p>

<p>Note the &ldquo;ng-controller&rdquo; element, it tells angular to use the controller named &ldquo;LatinizerCtrl&rdquo;, that is defined in the following javascript file:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">		function LatinizerCtrl($scope) {
    $scope.person = {
        firstName:&quot;&quot;,
        gender:&quot;&quot;
    };

    $scope.latinizeFirstName = function(person) {
        var latinFirstName = person.firstName;

        if(person.gender == &quot;Male&quot;) {
            latinFirstName += &quot;us&quot;;
        } else if(person.gender == &quot;Female&quot;) {
            if(person.firstName.match(/y$/)) {
                latinFirstName = latinFirstName.replace(/y$/, &quot;i&quot;);
            }
            latinFirstName += &quot;a&quot;;
        }

        if(person.firstName == &quot;&quot;) {
            latinFirstName = &quot;&quot;;
        }
        return latinFirstName;
    };
}
</code></pre>

<p>The first part of the controller sets up the <code>person</code> model, it has a first name and a gender, then the <code>latinizerFirstName</code> function takes the person, and based on their gender, gives them the appropriate latin first name.</p>

<p>I have not been able to find rules for converting last names to Latin. I have found large lists and tables of Latin surnames, but that is beyond the scope of this little exploration. Perhaps in the future I will make a server-side component, with a key-value store to convert surnames to Latin.</p>
