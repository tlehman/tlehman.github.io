			I recently became a father, and that experience has lead to me to wonder what my son will be like when he his older. It&rsquo;s also lead me remember what I was like when I was younger. I usually didn&rsquo;t take things my teachers said seriously, this has lead to good things and bad.
For the bad, I didn&rsquo;t try hard in math in high school, my SAT Math scores were terrible, way below average.

			Since 2012, when I first heard about Bitcoin, I&rsquo;ve thought it was a very cool application of cryptography and peer-to-peer networks that solves the problem of double spending and runaway inflation. Other than that, I didn&rsquo;t really think it was revolutionary, but a recent article by @ThoughtInfected has changed my mind.
The most thought-provoking quotes where:
 It is just such a huge game changer that a program could hold wealth in a way that is inaccessible to anyone, and then distribute said wealth based on defined and agreed mathematical rules.

		<div>
			I am switching away from MathJax for my math blogging for a few reasons, first one being that RSS readers won&rsquo;t see rendered formulas, and second one being that rendering complex formulae such as tables of aligned equations can be very slow.
Instead, I&rsquo;ve decided to use this Jekyll plugin to pre-render the formulae and insert images into the generated markup.
